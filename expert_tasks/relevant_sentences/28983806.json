            "As you can see, there is nothing special for Cat and Dog, the only one that know about them is the abstract class Animal, so when deserializing, you'll target to Animal and the ObjectMapper will return the actual instance as you can see in the following test:",
            "A simple way to enable polymorphic serialization / deserialization via Jackson library is to globally configure the Jackson object mapper -LRB- jackson.databind.ObjectMapper -RRB- to add information, such as the concrete class type, for certain kinds of classes, such as abstract classes.",
            "So, if you create a JSON directly -LRB- without serialization -RRB- remember to add the meta-property'' @class'' with the desired class name for correct deserialization."
