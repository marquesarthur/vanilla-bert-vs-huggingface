    "description": "I am developing an application which can record calls in Android.\nI have read a lot of topics where the call recording problem was discussed.\nAnd i know that not all Android phones can record calls.\nBut i am wondering how can record calls the most popular applications on Play Market, such as https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appstar.callrecorder or https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=polis.app.callrecorder.\nI think that thy are using not on MediaRecorder class to do this job, but also something else.\nBecause i have developed my own application, but i can record only my voice.\nBut these two applications are recording both my voice and the voice of a man to whom i am calling.\nHow they are doing this ?\nI know that we can't get an access to device speaker to record sound from it.\nCould you give me some ideas of how to record voice calls ?\nHere is my code that i am using in my application:",
