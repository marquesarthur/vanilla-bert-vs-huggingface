    "task": "Hilt: How to prevent Hilt from picking dependency from a library?",
    "description": "Okay, let's make this simple.\r\n\r\nI have created a simple library called `my-network-library` with two classes in it. First one is a Hilt module called `BaseNetworkModule`\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\n@Module\r\n@InstallIn(ApplicationComponent::class)\r\nobject BaseNetworkModule {\r\n\r\n    // Client\r\n    @Singleton\r\n    @Provides\r\n    fun provideOkHttpClient(): OkHttpClient {\r\n        return OkHttpClient.Builder()\r\n            // my default okhttp setup goes here \r\n            .build()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand the second one is a simple class.\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nclass MyAwesomeClass {\r\n    fun doMagic() {\r\n        // magic code goes here\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I want to use `MyAwesomeClass` in one of my App. So I added the dependency in the app.\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\nimplementation \"com.theapache64:my-awesome-library-1.0.0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also have some network call implementation and I don't want to use `OkHttpClient` from `my-network-library`. So I've created a module in the app to get my own instance of `OkHttpClient`.\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\n@Module\r\n@InstallIn(ApplicationComponent::class)\r\nobject NetworkModule {\r\n\r\n    @Singleton\r\n    @Provides\r\n    fun provideOkHttpClient(): OkHttpClient {\r\n        return OkHttpClient.Builder()\r\n            // CUSTOM CONFIG GOES HERE \r\n            .build()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow am getting below error.\r\n\r\n> error: [Dagger/DuplicateBindings] okhttp3.OkHttpClient is bound\r\n> multiple times:\r\n\r\nI know it's because of the `@Provides` declared in the `my-network-library`, but I didn't specify `includes` to the `@Module` annotation to inherit dependency from `BaseNetworkModule`. The issue may be fixed using `@Qualifier` annotation, but IMO, that'd be a workaround. \r\n\r\nso my question is \r\n- Why dependency from a library module comes into the app module without using `includes` of `@Module`?\r\n- How to tell Hilt \"Do not look for @Provides in external libraries (gradle dependencies) ?\" unless I mark the module with `@Module(includes = XXXModule)`\r\n\r\nSource : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63276876/how-to-prevent-hilt-from-picking-dependency-from-a-library",
